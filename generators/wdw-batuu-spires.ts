/**
 * The rock spires of Black Spire Outpost, Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, Disney's
 * Hollywood Studios — procedural, CC0-1.0.
 * bun generators/wdw-batuu-spires.ts
 *
 * Map frame: x east, y north, z up, metres, bearing 0. The origin is the
 * mean of the five main spires' bases. One model holds the whole group,
 * since the spires are one piece of rockwork and read as a group from every
 * side.
 *
 * The spires are the petrified trees the outpost is named after: craggy
 * blue-grey stone needles, fluted with vertical clefts, narrowing unevenly
 * and leaning a little, with sharp lesser points clustered round their tops
 * and stepping down their flanks. They grow in fused clusters out of broad,
 * low mesas of layered tan and ochre rockwork. The tallest group stands
 * behind the Millennium Falcon, along the north and west face of Smugglers
 * Run's show building (way/688502132), which wraps round the Falcon's
 * courtyard. Every base falls inside that building's outline, so the model
 * replaces nothing: the show building is far larger and keeps its own
 * extrusion.
 *
 * Evidence
 * - Published: 135 ft (41 m) spires (Wikipedia, "Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge";
 *   fan sites give "more than 130 feet" for the tallest). The figure may be
 *   Disneyland's; Florida's tallest is taken to match.
 * - Photos from the courtyard: Commons, Jedi94 (CC BY-SA 4.0; "Black Spire,
 *   Walt Disney World" and "Star Wars, Galaxy's Edge at WDW"), Eden, Janine
 *   and Jim (CC BY 2.0), Steven Miller (CC BY 2.0), Ekynox mg (CC BY-SA 4.0);
 *   Mapillary, jonahadkins and Lanka6359 (CC BY-SA 4.0). They show two tall
 *   needles behind the Falcon with a tunnel between them, a shorter crown of
 *   points west of them and lower needles further round, all rising from a
 *   tan rock mass about 40% of their height.
 * - Positions: bearings to each spire from two Mapillary photos, their camera
 *   poses solved against the Falcon model's cockpit and mandible tips, and
 *   cross-checked with the long north-pointing spire shadows across the
 *   courtyard in the USGS NAIP orthophoto (public domain).
 * - OSM's natural=bare_rock areas in the land (way/720122310, 732497074–6,
 *   805583653, 805720820, 805936653–4, 823713027, 823729287, 589550174,
 *   823707702, 823709426, 770929187, 1090823872) are the low rockwork walls
 *   round the Resistance camp and the market, and the outcrops in the market;
 *   none of them is under a spire, so none is used.
 *
 * Doubts: the positions rest on two photo bearings that cross at a narrow
 * angle, so each spire may be off by 5 to 10 m along the line of sight. The
 * heights other than the tallest are scaled from the photos. The mesas'
 * outline and height are estimated from the photos; the needles' facets and
 * lesser points are a stylised stand-in for the sculpted rock.
