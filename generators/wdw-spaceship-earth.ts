/**
 * Spaceship Earth, EPCOT (Walt Disney World) — procedural, CC0-1.0.
 * bun generators/wdw-spaceship-earth.ts
 *
 * Map frame: x east, y north, z up, metres; origin on the ground at the
 * centre of the circle fitted to the OSM outline (way/146221550: radius
 * 25.45 m, every node within 0.1 m of it). Placed at
 * bearing 0: the park's entrance axis runs north–south through the sphere.
 *
 * A geodesic sphere of silver triangular facets held off the ground on three
 * pairs of steel legs. It is modelled as what it is: a subdivided
 * icosahedron, each triangle raised into a shallow three-sided pyramid as the
 * real cladding is, flat-shaded so every facet catches the light on its own.
 * The facet variation is a second, slightly darker silver on three pyramids
 * in ten, as the real panels differ a little in tone.
 * Under the sphere sit a dark glazed entrance core and, to the south, the low
 * block joining it to the Project Tomorrow building.
 *
 * Evidence:
 * - OSM: outline way/146221550 (height 55, roof dome), and two buildings
 *   wholly inside it — way/295176801 (3 levels, the core under the sphere)
 *   and way/298641632 (a trapezoid on the south side under the sphere). The
 *   model covers all three; a 3-level extrusion would poke through the
 *   sphere's underside if left drawn. Project Tomorrow (way/295176970,
 *   tagged 25 m) is a separate building to the south and stays drawn.
 * - Published (Wikipedia, Disney): 180 ft (54.9 m) tall, 165 ft (50.3 m)
 *   across, so the sphere clears the ground by about 4.6 m; six legs in
 *   three pairs.
 * - Photos (Wikimedia Commons, credited in the report): the entrance views
 *   from the north (chensiyuan 2010, Katie Rommel-Esham, InSapphoWeTrust,
 *   Theme Park Tourist 2015) and the 2019 aerial from the south-west
 *   (Gfgbeach). They give the leg pairs at the north-east and north-west,
 *   left and right of the entrance, and the third pair to the south under
 *   Project Tomorrow; the facet density (about 32 facets across the visible
 *   face, so frequency 10; the model uses 8 for the file budget); and the
 *   colours: silver facets, legs with a pale top and warm grey flanks.
 * - Estimated: the legs' cross-section, slope (about 66°) and spread, and
 *   where they meet the sphere (about 12 m up). The entrance photos and the
 *   aerial disagree on how far the feet spread, so the model splits the
 *   difference, and the pairs are set at exactly 60°, 180° and 300°. Also
 *   estimated: the core's radius and height, the south block's 6 m (from
 *   the aerial) and the pyramid depth. The icosahedron's orientation (a
 *   vertex at the top) is a choice; the real panel layout isn't recorded.
