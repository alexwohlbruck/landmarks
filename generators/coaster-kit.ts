/**
 * Shared kit for the roller coaster generators (Carowinds): the plan from an
 * OSM track chain, a vertical profile built from a list of named elements, an
 * energy check, banking from speed and curvature, and the swept track,
 * supports and station canopy. A generator is its data plus one call to
 * `buildCoaster`. A development tool for authoring models; nothing in the API
 * runs it.
 *
 * Profile. OSM has the plan but no heights, so the height of the track is
 * given as a list of elements in ride order, each at a distance along the OSM
 * polyline (`s`, metres from its first node) with a height above the local
 * ground (`z`). Every element is a crest, a valley or the end of a level run.
 * Between two elements the track is a circular arc out of the first, a
 * straight, and an arc into the second (the common tangent of the two
 * circles), which is how a coaster's hills are really drawn: rounded tops,
 * straight legs, tight valleys. Each arc's radius comes from the train's speed
 * there (a crest just under weightless, a valley at about 3.5 g) unless the
 * element sets `r`, and shrinks when two elements are too close for it.
 *
 * Energy. The train's head of energy starts at the lift crest and falls by
 * `friction` metres for every metre of track (B&M hypers lose roughly 2 to
 * 3 % of the lift height per 100 m); a block brake resets it. The report
 * flags any stretch where the train would stall, which means a hill is too
 * high or too late for the energy left.
 *
 * Run a generator with REPORT=1 for the element table and the energy check,
 * COASTER_DUMP=<file> for the centreline in the park frame (for matching
 * photos), CLEARANCE=1 for near-misses between stretches of track.
